## API Tokens

### AI Horde
A default community token is provided with the application that comes loaded with kudos!

### HuggingFace
You'll need to register for a free HuggingFace account and use your token. Free accounts receive approximately 200 H100 GPU seconds per day.

### Fyrean
The 3D model generation [TRELLIS](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS) is hosted by me on my potato PC, no API key needed but will probably get overwhelmed during high demand times.
